    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This refined pastry also called Khobz el bey comes from the Algerian Arabic meaning
         "bread of the bey" because as said before, its creation dates back to the Ottoman period
         of the city of Algiers, from where the name of this snack very appreciated by the beys of Algiers.
         As for its main name "Khobz el Tounes", it is said that the "Tounes" is the name of its creator, an Algerois woman.
        
        It is a perfectly anti-waste sweetness, because we are going to recycle stale bread,
        which we are going to reduce to breadcrumbs, mix with pruned and coarsely
        crushed dried fruit, a little melted butter and a few eggs, and here we are
        with a nice delicacy with the scent of orange blossom which is even more accentuated,
        once taken out of the oven and drizzled with a syrup well scented with orange blossom.
